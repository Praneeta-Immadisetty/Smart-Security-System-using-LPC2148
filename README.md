# Smart-Security-System-using-LPC2148
This is a smart authentication system applicable for bank security.
We are addressing the need for a smart security system in banks to ensure safe and secure
transactions and possession of one’s money. With the help of the keyboard and serial monitor, we
code a password, which when correctly entered opens the door using a stepper motor and
displays on the LCD display that “Password Correct, Please Enter” and on the seven segment
display an appropriate welcome message.
But in the case where the password entered is incorrect, a buzzer alarm rings. The user
has 4 attempts to successfully enter the correct password. The LCD display and seven segment
display yet again display appropriate messages.
